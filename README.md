## Description

Simply Zen is an elegant, content rich mindfulness app that was developed for people who want to learn how to mediate and enjoy the benefits that a mindfulness practice can bring.

## Purpose

This started as my final project for Udacity's iOS Degree course.

## Accessing Settings

* Double tap on the screen (no access from meditation and completed session screens)
* Tap on gear icon in top right corner

## What Works

* Animated Menus
* Open Meditations Work
* Bell type for open meditations can be selected in settings
* HealthKit integration
* Use Core Data to log meditation sessions
* Twitter Support
* Use REST API to pull down quotes of the day

## TODO

* Add Accessability (Next Version)
* Implement 3D-Touch
* Add my own photos for quote of the day
* Add user history / history details screens
* Probably some stuff I haven't thought of yet
