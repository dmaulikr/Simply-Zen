## Description

This is a mindfulness app for users of all skill levels.  A high level mock-up can be found on [Prezi](https://prezi.com/view/cOvZsPdSOVXgDdZN8T5v/).

## Purpose

This started as my final project for Udacity's iOS Degree course.

## What Works

* Animated Menus
* Open Meditations Work
* HealthKit integration
* Core Data is setup (but not really being used yet)

## TODO

* Use Core Data to log meditation sessions
* Create settings screen
* Record guided meditations
* Create guided meditation courses
* Implement 3D-Touch
* Add Twitter Support
* Use REST API to pull down quotes of the day
* Add photos for quote of the day
* Smooth transitions
* Add user history / history details screens
* Create first time tutorial splash screen
* Finish this and then start on Apple TV Version
* Probably some stuff I haven't thought of yet
